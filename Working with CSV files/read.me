ðŸ“˜ CSV File Handling using Pandas
This project demonstrates various ways to load, read, and manipulate CSV files using the pandas library in Python.
It covers all essential parameters and techniques needed for efficient data handling.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Covered
Importing pandas
Load the pandas library to work with structured data efficiently.
Opening CSV Files
From local storage using pd.read_csv('file.csv')
From a URL using the requests module and StringIO
Customizing File Reading
sep â†’ specify a custom separator (e.g., \t for TSV files)
index_col â†’ set a specific column as the DataFrame index
header â†’ choose which row to use as column headers
usecols â†’ select specific columns to read
squeeze â†’ read a single column as a pandas Series
nrows & skiprows â†’ control how many rows to read or skip
encoding â†’ handle files with different character encodings (e.g., "latin-1")
error_bad_lines=False â†’ skip lines with parsing errors
dtype â†’ set data types for specific columns
parse_dates â†’ automatically parse date columns
converters â†’ apply custom functions to transform column values
na_values â†’ define custom missing value indicators
Reading Large Datasets in Chunks
Use chunksize to load large files in smaller portions and process them iteratively.
