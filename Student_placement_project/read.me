# ðŸ§  Project Overview
### This project predicts whether a student will get placed (1) or not (0) based on two factors:
## CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
## IQ (Intelligence Quotient)
### We use Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm, to model the relationship between these features and placement status.


## ðŸªœ Steps Overview

### 1. Preprocessing + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 2. Feature Selection

### 3. Train-Test Split

### 4. Feature Scaling

### 5. Model Training

### 6. Model Evaluation / Model Selection

### 7. Model Deployment
